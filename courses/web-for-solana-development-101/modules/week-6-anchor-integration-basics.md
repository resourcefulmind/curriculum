# Week 6: Anchor Integration Basics

## Overview

This week introduces integrating Anchor programs in web applications. Topics include working with Anchor IDLs, generating TypeScript types, and building type-safe interactions with on-chain programs using the `@coral-xyz/anchor` client library alongside gill.

## Learning Objectives

Learning outcomes for this week include:

1. Understand Anchor IDL structure and purpose  
2. Set up Anchor client with gill and wallet-ui  
3. Generate and use TypeScript types from IDLs  
4. Call program instructions with type safety  
5. Handle program errors gracefully  

## Lessons

### Lesson 1: Understanding Anchor IDLs

**Topics Covered:**

- What is an IDL and why it matters  
- IDL structure: instructions, accounts, types, errors  
- IDL generation from Anchor programs  
- Version management and updates  
- Using IDLs for client generation  

**Lab Exercise: Anchor Setup and IDL Exploration**

1. **IDL Type Definition Structure:**
   - Define TypeScript type for your program IDL including:
     - Version and name metadata
     - Instructions array with:
       - Instruction names
       - Account requirements (mutability, signer status)
       - Argument definitions with types
     - Account type definitions with:
       - Struct fields and their types
       - Field names matching on-chain structure

2. **useAnchorProgram Hook Implementation:**
   - Use wallet-ui hooks to get wallet functions
   - Create gill Solana client for RPC connection
   - Implement `useMemo` for program instance that:
     - Returns null if no wallet connected
     - Creates `Connection` from gill client URL
     - Constructs wallet object with signing functions
     - Initializes `AnchorProvider` with connection and wallet
     - Sets provider globally with `setProvider`
     - Creates and returns `Program` instance with IDL and address

3. **IDLExplorer Component:**
   - Build visual IDL explorer that displays:
     - Program metadata (name, version, address)
     - Instructions list with:
       - Instruction names
       - Argument and account counts
       - Visual hierarchy indicators
     - Account types with:
       - Type names
       - Field counts
   - Use proper styling and handle missing data gracefully

**Key Concepts:**

- IDL as contract ABI  
- Type generation benefits  
- Provider setup with wallet  
- Program instantiation  
- Version compatibility

### Lesson 2: Calling Program Instructions

**Topics Covered:**

- Using program methods namespace  
- Account resolution patterns  
- Passing instruction arguments  
- Transaction options and configuration  
- Handling responses  

**Lab Exercise: Program Interaction Implementation**

**Component Setup:**

- Use custom Anchor program hook  
- Manage loading and data states  
- Create input interface for user data  

**Initialize Account Function:**

- Check program availability before proceeding  
- Set loading state appropriately  
- Generate PDA using:
  - Seed array with `'data-account'` and user public key
  - Program ID for derivation
- Call program instruction using:
  - `methods` namespace with instruction name
  - Pass required arguments
  - Provide `accounts` object
  - Execute with `.rpc()` method  
- After transaction:
  - Log transaction signature
  - Fetch created account data  
- Handle errors with:
  - Anchor error parsing
  - User-friendly messages
  - Cleanup in `finally` block  

**Update Data Function:**

- Derive PDA same as initialization  
- Use program methods with RPC options:
  - `skipPreflight`, `commitment`, `maxRetries`  
- Handle errors with a dedicated error handler  

**Build Transaction Alternative:**

- Use `.instruction()` to get raw instruction  
- Use `.transaction()` to get full transaction  
- Useful for offline signing or batching  

**Error Handling Helper:**

- Parse Anchor-specific errors:
  - Extract error code and message
  - Log and return structured error object
- Handle unknown errors with fallback messaging  

**UI Components:**

- Data input field  
- Initialize and Update buttons  
- Loading states and disabled conditions  
- Integrated error display component  

**Key Concepts:**

- `methods` namespace usage  
- Account resolution and PDA generation  
- Transaction options  
- Error handling patterns

### Lesson 3: Type Safety and Error Handling

**Topics Covered:**

- Leveraging TypeScript with IDL types  
- Custom error handling  
- Program event parsing  
- Type guards and validation  
- Development vs production patterns  

**Lab Exercise: Type-Safe Program Client**

1. **Type Extraction Setup:**

- Use Anchor utilities:
  - `IdlTypes`, `IdlAccounts`, `IdlEvents`  
- Create program-specific aliases  

2. **TypeSafeProgramClient Class:**

- **Constructor:**
  - Accept typed `Program` instance  
- **createUserProfile():**
  - Strongly typed parameters and return value  
  - Use TypeScript for argument/account validation  
- **getAllProfiles():**
  - Return array of typed profile accounts  
  - Use `account.all()` with memcmp filter  
- **subscribeToEvents():**
  - Register typed event listener using IDL events  
- **parseError():**
  - Extract known Anchor errors or fallback  
- **derivePDA():**
  - Reusable PDA helper returning `PublicKey`  

3. **Usage Component:**

- Maintain typed state  
- Subscribe to events in `useEffect`  
- Fetch and display account data  
- Ensure cleanup on unmount  

**Key Concepts:**

- IDL type extraction  
- Client wrapper pattern  
- Type-safe method execution  
- Event typing and subscription  
- Strongly typed error objects

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Provider not initialized

**Solution:**  
- Ensure wallet is connected  
- Check for valid `publicKey`  
- Display error or prompt user  
- Lazy load provider only after wallet exists  

### Issue: Account doesn’t exist

**Solution:**  
- Use `getAccountInfo` before reading  
- Return fallback or prompt init  
- Auto-create account when appropriate  

### Issue: Type errors with IDL

**Solution:**  
- Regenerate IDL types with Anchor CLI  
- Import generated types  
- Sync types with latest on-chain code
