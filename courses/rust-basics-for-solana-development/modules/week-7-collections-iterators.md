# Week 7: Collections & Iterators

## Learning Objectives

- Use Vec<T> and HashMap effectively
- Master iterator patterns
- Chain iterator methods
- Understand iterator performance

## Topics Covered

- Vector operations and capacity
- HashMap and BTreeMap
- Iterator trait and methods
- collect() and type annotations
- Iterator combinators

## Hands-on Exercises

1. **Address Book**: HashMap-based storage
2. **Iterator Gym**: Practice with map, filter, fold
3. **Collection Transformer**: Convert between collection types
