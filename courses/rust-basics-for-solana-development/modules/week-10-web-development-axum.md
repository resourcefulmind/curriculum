- Implement middleware

## Topics Covered

- Axum basics and routing
- Handler functions
- Extractors and responses
- State management
- Basic middleware

## Hands-on Exercises

1. **Hello API**: Basic REST endpoints
2. **CRUD Server**: In-memory data store
3. **Middleware Logger**: Request logging

## Reading Assignment

- [Axum documentation](https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/)
- [Web Programming with Rust guide](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Rust-Web-Programming-2nd-Edition)

## Homework

- Build a multi-endpoint API server with at least 5 routes
- Add authentication middleware that checks API key in headers.
- Study these [Axum examples](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum/tree/main/examples):
  - [`hello-world`](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum/tree/main/examples/hello-world)
  - [`todos`](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum/tree/main/examples/todos) (CRUD operations)
  - [`jwt`](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum/tree/main/examples/jwt) (authentication patterns)
